# ShopNodeJS
Hello everyone. This is the codebase I made while learning NodeJS. I had a lot of fun in my NodeJS journey so far and I hope the codebase I shared below is of use to you guys. This application leverages a lot of exciting NodeJS packages and the further documentation is soon going to be added here. Enjoy!!!

## Instructions for installing and running the code

* Run npm install to download packages.
* Make a Images folder and ensure that it is in the main project directory
* Enter your own mongo_db_uri
* Enter your own stripe private key to create a payment session.
